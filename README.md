This is the final project for the Microsoft Data Science Professional Certificate program.  The project was set up as a data
science competition through [DrivenData](https://www.datasciencecapstone.org/competitions/1/student-loans/page/1/).  The goal was to predict student loan repayment rate which is defined as the percentage
of students actively reducing the balance of their loans.  This is seen as a better metric than default rate where the student
failed to make payments or made payments that did not reduce the balance of the loan.  Repayment rate is seen as a proxy for 
gainful employment that allows the former student to pay down the loan balance.  Gaining insight into the predictors of loan repayment rates could help students make better decisions when applying to schools.
